Description: A robust constrained L1 minimization method for estimating a large sparse inverse covariance matrix (aka precision matrix), and recovering its support for building graphical models.  The computation uses linear programming.  The method was published in TT Cai, W Liu, X Luo (2011) <doi:10.1198/jasa.2011.tm10155>.
