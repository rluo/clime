This is an R package for **Constrained L1 Inverse Covariance Estimation**. 

You can use `R CMD build clime` to create the source tar file. This should be the same as the CRAN [clime](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clime/index.html)  package, as I will try to update the CRAN source as well.
